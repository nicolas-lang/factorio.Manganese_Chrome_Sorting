# Pure Manganese/Chrome Sorting
Adds recipes for pure manganese and chrome sorting using crushed ferrous or and ferrous crystals, respectively. Manganese has really nice recipes but doesn't have its own sorting option by default, and chrome is used in the mod Circuit Processing in mass quantities but with no reasonable way to produce it: hence, this mod.
